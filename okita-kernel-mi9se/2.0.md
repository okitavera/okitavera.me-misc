- Merge "nathanchance/android-kernel-clang/tree/msm-4.9-pie" (Now this kernel is compiled with aosp clang)
- Add CAF audio-kernel with Xiaomi's patchset and some fixes from Flex1911, (hope) it fixes proximity problems on some custom MIUI ROMs.
- Add schedutil CPU Governor from Pixel devices (rebranded as schedutil_pixel)
