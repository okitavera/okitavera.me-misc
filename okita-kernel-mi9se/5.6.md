- Merge Upstream Linux v4.9.188
- Bring several cpufreq and scheduler improvement from aosp's kernel/common
- Bring zstd compression from aosp's kernel/common (lz4 are still used by default for zRAM, so experiment yourself)
- Set maximum zRAM creation limits to 2GB (Xiaomi use 2.6GB by default, so that's why I limit that to 1.5GB before)
- Also bring the lzo-rle compression from mainline (yes, I'm still with lz4)
- Fix SchedTune-boosted tasks being migrated to little-cluster (thanks to @RenderBroken)
- Let SchedTune's top-app boost value to be adjusted by user (たぶんｗｗｗ)
- Drop unused selftest from goodix_ts driver (even the QC Test are still working, so...)
- Reduce cpu idle overheads caused by event logging (thanks to @kdrag0n)
- Reduce unnecessary logging and overheads on wlan module (thanks to @arter97)
